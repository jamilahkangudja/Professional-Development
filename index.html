    <h1>Teaching, Instructional Design, & Program Practice</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      This portfolio documents my approach to course design, program development,
      and student-centered learning in higher education. The work presented here
      reflects an emphasis on modular structure, reflective practice, and the
      intentional use of emerging tools to support learning outcomes.

      <h2>About My Practice</h2>
      <p>
        My work sits at the intersection of teaching, instructional design, and
        program development. I design learning experiences for students who are
        navigating higher education with varied levels of academic preparation,
        professional exposure, and institutional familiarity—many of whom are
        first-generation college students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Across my work, I prioritize clarity of structure, intentional scaffolding,
        and reflection as a tool for meaning-making. I approach design as an
        iterative process, refining content and learning pathways based on student
        engagement, feedback, and observed needs.

            An instructional design case study examining the development of an
            8-week, Canvas-based course for first-year business students. The course
            emphasizes career readiness, guided reflection, and skill articulation
            through scaffolded, practice-based learning experiences.

      <h2>Pedagogical & Design Orientation</h2>
      <p>
        My design practice is grounded in clarity, structure, and accessibility for
        students with varied levels of academic and professional preparedness. I view
        instructional design as an iterative process—one that balances intentional
        scaffolding with opportunities for exploration, reflection, and growth.
