    <h1>BUSI 1200: Careers & Professional Development</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Instructional Design Case Study</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Course Context</h2>
      <p>
        BUSI 1200 is an 8-week, first-year course focused on career readiness,
        reflection, and professional skill articulation. The course supports students
        with varied levels of academic and professional preparedness, including many
        first-generation college students navigating institutional systems and career
        exploration for the first time.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Design Challenge & Constraints</h2>
      <p>
        The primary design challenge was creating a structured yet flexible learning
        experience within a compressed 8-week timeline. Students entered the course
        with uneven familiarity with professional development concepts, requiring
        intentional scaffolding to manage cognitive load while maintaining momentum.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Instructional Design Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Course design centered on modular, Canvas-native pages that emphasized
        consistency, predictability, and guided progression. Learning experiences were
        intentionally sequenced to reinforce connections between goal setting,
        self-assessment, professional documents, and career exploration.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Weekly modular structure with clear completion pathways</li>
        <li>Prerequisite gating to encourage sequential engagement</li>
        <li>Practice-based activities over passive content consumption</li>
        <li>Reflection used as both a learning and assessment tool</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Design in Practice: Selected Instructional Artifacts</h2>
      <p>
        The following instructional artifacts demonstrate how course design principles
        were translated into student-facing learning experiences. Each artifact reflects
        intentional decisions to support clarity, engagement, and skill articulation
        across the progression of the course.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <h3>ONET Career Explorer Guide</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Design goal:</strong> Prepare students to navigate labor market data
          and career exploration tools without becoming overwhelmed by unfamiliar
          terminology or interface complexity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Instructional move:</strong> A guided ONET Career Explorer Guide was
          developed to walk students through key ONET concepts and navigation prior
          to engaging directly with the ONET Online platform. The activity was
          intentionally placed after goal setting, self-assessment, and professional
          document development to encourage reflection on alignment.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Why it works:</strong> By front-loading conceptual understanding and
          sequencing the activity after foundational self-work, students were able to
          interpret career data through the lens of their existing goals and materials.

      <div class="example">
        <h3>Resume Forensic Lab: Applicant Tracking System (ATS) Simulation</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Design goal:</strong> Help students understand how applicant tracking
          systems evaluate resumes and why formatting and structure directly impact
          screening outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Instructional move:</strong> An interactive Resume Forensic Lab was
          designed to simulate how ATS parses resume content. Students observed how
          improper formatting, images, and unconventional headings result in resumes
          being deprioritized or rejected.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Why it works:</strong> Making the ATS process visible transformed an
          abstract concept into a concrete learning experience, leading to more
          intentional formatting decisions in subsequent resume drafts.
        </p>

      <h2>Use of AI in Instructional Design</h2>
      <p>
        AI tools were used to support instructional design by assisting with the
        drafting of instructional language, generating example scenarios, and refining
        clarity. All AI-assisted content was reviewed and aligned with learning
        objectives to ensure that pedagogy, not automation, guided design decisions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Reflection & Iteration</h2>
      <p>
        Course design decisions were refined throughout the term based on student
        engagement patterns and feedback. Observations of confusion or overload
        informed adjustments to instructional language and pacing. Future iterations
        will continue to strengthen alignment between structure, reflection, and
        professional skill development.
