  <p><em>Instructional Design Case Study</em></p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Course Snapshot</h2>
    <p>
      BUSI 1200 is an 8-week, first-year course focused on career readiness,
      reflection, and professional skill articulation. The course is designed
      for students with varying levels of academic and professional preparedness,
      including many first-generation college students.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Instructional Design Approach</h2>
    <p>
      Course content is delivered through modular Canvas-based pages that prioritize
      clarity, structure, and student engagement. Learning experiences are scaffolded
      to reduce overwhelm and encourage practice-based learning rather than passive
      content consumption.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Weekly modular structure</li>
      <li>Clear prerequisites to unlock content</li>
      <li>Practice → reflection → feedback loop</li>
      <li>Low-stakes, high-engagement activities</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Featured Instructional Artifact</h2>
    <p>
      The linked page below represents a live instructional artifact used by students
      in BUSI 1200. It mirrors the structure of a Canvas module page and includes
      learning objectives, activities, and guided reflection prompts.

    <h2>Use of AI in Content Development</h2>
    <p>
      AI tools were used to support instructional design by prototyping content,
      generating examples, and refining language for clarity and accessibility.
      All AI-assisted outputs were reviewed, edited, and aligned to course learning
      objectives by the instructor.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Reflection & Iteration</h2>
    <p>
      Course design decisions were refined over time based on student engagement,
      feedback, and observed areas of confusion. Emphasis on modular structure and
      guided reflection helped students better articulate skills and career interests.
      Future iterations will continue to balance structure with flexibility.
