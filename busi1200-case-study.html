    <p class="subtitle">Instructional Design Case Study</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Course Context</h2>
      <p>
        BUSI 1200 is an 8-week, first-year course focused on career readiness,
        reflection, and professional skill articulation. The course serves students
        with varied levels of academic and professional preparedness, including
        many first-generation college students navigating institutional systems
        and career exploration for the first time.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Design Challenge & Constraints</h2>
      <p>
        The primary design challenge was creating a structured yet flexible learning
        experience within a compressed 8-week timeline. Students entered the course
        with wide-ranging familiarity with professional development concepts, making
        clarity of expectations and cognitive load management essential. The course
        needed to balance skill development with reflection while maintaining
        accessibility within a Canvas-based environment.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Instructional Design Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Course design centered on modular, Canvas-native pages that emphasized
        consistency, predictability, and guided progression. Learning experiences
        were scaffolded to reduce overwhelm and support student confidence through
        repeated cycles of practice, reflection, and feedback.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Weekly modular structure with clear completion pathways</li>
        <li>Prerequisite gating to encourage sequential engagement</li>
        <li>Practice-based activities over passive content consumption</li>
        <li>Reflection used as both a learning and assessment tool</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Design in Practice: Selected Examples</h2>
      <p>
        The following examples highlight how instructional design principles were
        translated into concrete learning experiences within BUSI 1200. Each example
        reflects intentional design choices made to support clarity, engagement,
        and skill articulation.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <h3>Design Example: Career Research Module</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Design goal:</strong> Support students in exploring potential
          career pathways while reducing intimidation associated with labor market
          data and unfamiliar research tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Instructional move:</strong> The module guided students through
          career research using structured prompts and curated resources, allowing
          them to focus on interpretation rather than navigation. Scaffolded questions
          helped students translate research into personal insights.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Why it works:</strong> By breaking research into manageable steps
          and emphasizing reflection, students were able to engage meaningfully with
          career information without becoming overwhelmed.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <h3>Design Example: Resume Court</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Design goal:</strong> Encourage students to critically evaluate
          resumes and articulate professional strengths without the pressure of
          immediate self-presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Instructional move:</strong> Students analyzed sample resumes
          through guided criteria, shifting focus from personal performance to
          skill recognition and constructive critique.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Why it works:</strong> This approach lowered affective barriers and
          helped students develop evaluative skills that later supported their own
          resume development.

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Use of AI in Instructional Design</h2>
      <p>
        AI tools were used as a support for instructional design by assisting with
        the drafting of instructional language, generating example scenarios, and
        refining clarity. All AI-assisted content was reviewed and aligned with
        learning objectives, ensuring that pedagogy—not automation—guided design
        decisions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Reflection & Iteration</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout the course, design decisions were refined in response to student
        engagement patterns and feedback. Observations of student confusion or
        overload informed adjustments to instructional language and pacing. Future
        iterations will continue to refine the balance between structure and
        flexibility as student needs evolve.
